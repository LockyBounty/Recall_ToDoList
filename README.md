# Recall todo list 
- - - -

### Description
Welcome Back my beloved students!
I hope you had an awesome break and that you are ready to get back on track ! Now before we jump into React.js and all the new things this technology can provide, I would like you to work on a small todo list which will ask you to use all the knowledge you have gathered during the first three months of BeCode.

### Technologies
To make it through this exercice, you will need to use the following technologies.
* HTML_CSS_JS
* Ajax (xmlhttprequest or fetch)
* Node.js Express
* Mongoose
* JWT

### Statement
Your mission if you wish to accept it will be to create a full pledge online todo list. This is the sequence: A user can sign up then sign in to authenticate himself on the platform (mail + password). A user will then be able to access his todo list. There, the user can ADD a new todo, UPDATE the todo to change the text, DELETE a todo when it’s done.

You will have to use a REST API for your backend to store your data.
And you will only need two Schema models.
Don’t forget to use JWT to secure your routes.


### Bonuses
Set your todo application in production with Heroku (for the backend) and git page for your front.


## Onward my friends !
